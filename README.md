> Consume React components in Ember

This addon is a proof-of-concept for an approach to rendering React components in Ember. It is almost entirely inspired by [a blog post][blog-post] by [Sivakumar Kailasam][sivakumar], from which the general idea was borrowed.

Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```bash
ember install ember-react-components
```

Compatibility
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This addon requires Ember CLI 2.15 or higher.

Usage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This addon provides an ES6 class decorator that allows a React element to be rendered in Ember.

As an example, you can create a component like this:

```javascript
// app/components/my-react-component.js
import React from 'react';
import WithEmberSupport from 'ember-react-components';

@WithEmberSupport
export default class extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const { name } = this.props;

    return (
      <p>Hello, {name}</p>
    );
  }
}
```

And render it like this:

```handlebars
{{my-react-component name='Alex'}}
```

That would create a component that renders `Hello, Alex`.

Options
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* `outputFile` option imports `react` and `react-dom` into a separate file than `/assets/vendor.js`. This is useful if your entire Ember application doesn't require `react`. The separate file containing `react` and `react-dom` can be imported via a template or initializer.

```javascript
// ember-cli-build.js
let app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
  'ember-react-components': {
    outputFile: '/assets/react.js'
  }
});
```

What all is this addon doing?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Provides imports for `react` and `react-dom`
* Hooks up a bunch of necessary `babel` transforms
* Provides a decorator for creating a thin wrapper around your React components that bridge the gap between the two libraries

Is this production ready?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It _does_ work, but you should be really careful about including both the Ember _and_ React libraries in your application since that's quite a lot of JavaScript to ship to your users.
